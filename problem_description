Pathfinding in a Maze:

    Given a maze represented as a binary matrix, find a path from the top-left corner (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (n-1, m-1) using BFS or DFS. Return the path if it exists.
Problem Overview

You want to find a path from the top-left corner of a maze (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (n-1, m-1) in a binary matrix. The maze consists of:

    0: Open path (you can move here).
    1: Wall or obstacle (you cannot move here).

Approach

    Representing the Maze:
        Use a 2D list (matrix) to represent the maze. For example:

    maze = [
        [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
        [0, 1, 1, 1, 0],
        [0, 0, 0, 1, 0],
        [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
        [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
    ]

Choosing the Algorithm:

    You can use either BFS or DFS. BFS is typically used for shortest path finding in unweighted grids, while DFS is good for exploring all paths.

Movement Directions:

    You can move in four possible directions: up, down, left, and right. You can represent these movements with coordinate changes:

    python

        directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]  # Down, Up, Right, Left

    Tracking Visited Cells:
        Maintain a set or a 2D list to keep track of visited cells to avoid infinite loops.

    Base Cases:
        Check if the starting point (0, 0) or the endpoint (n-1, m-1) is a wall. If either is a wall, return that no path exists.

    Recursive Exploration (for DFS) or Queue (for BFS):
        If using DFS, you'll recursively call your function for each valid move.
        If using BFS, initialize a queue and iteratively explore each node.

    Checking for Boundaries:
        Ensure that the next cell you want to move to is within the bounds of the maze, is not a wall, and hasn't been visited.

    Stopping Condition:
        If you reach the destination (n-1, m-1), you've found a path! Return it or mark it as found.

Pseudocode Structure

Here's a rough outline of what your code structure might look like:

python

def pathfinding(maze):
    # Initialize starting point and check if it's valid
    # Create a visited structure
    # Define directions

    def dfs(x, y):
        # Base cases (check if out of bounds, wall, or visited)
        # If reached the end, return success or path
        
        for direction in directions:
            # Calculate new position (next_x, next_y)
            # Recursive call or add to queue (if BFS)
    
    # Start the search
    # Call dfs or bfs

Summary

    Set up the maze representation.
    Choose between BFS and DFS.
    Implement movement and boundary checks.
    Track visited cells.
    Check for a path and handle the stopping condition.
